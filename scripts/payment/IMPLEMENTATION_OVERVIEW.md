   - Process payment transaction
   - Update inventory quantities
   - Track sales and earnings

4. **Post-Purchase Services**:
   - Process refunds when needed
   - Update buyer spending history
   - Generate sales reports

## 🎯 Key Capabilities

### **Multi-Contract Support**
- Handles multiple contract types simultaneously

- Dynamic snack pricing
- Quantity-based calculations
- Automatic total computation

### **Real-time Monitoring**
- Live balance tracking
- Transaction status updates
- Payment confirmation
- Error logging

### **Automated Workflows**
- End-to-end payment demonstrations
- Batch operations
- Sequential transaction processing
- Comprehensive testing scenarios

## 📊 Usage Examples

### **Quick Commands**
```bash
# Run complete payment demonstration
npm run payment-demo

# Deploy all contracts
npm run deploy

# Test exam payments only
npm run exam-payment

# Test snack purchases only
npm run snacks-payment

# Validate setup
npm run test-setup
```

### **Manual Script Execution**
```bash
# Start Hardhat local network
npx hardhat node

# In another terminal, run payment scripts
node scripts/payment/masterPaymentScript.js
```

## 🔍 Testing Integration

The payment scripts are designed to work alongside your existing test suite:
- Compatible with existing test structure
- Uses same contract compilation artifacts
- Maintains test account consistency
- Supports both automated and manual testing

## 🚀 Demo Scenarios Included

### **Complete Payment Demo**
- Deploys all contracts
- Sets up exam with fee payment
- Processes multiple snack purchases
- Demonstrates refund functionality
- Generates comprehensive payment report

### **Individual Workflows**
- Exam fee payment simulation
- Multi-buyer snack purchasing
- Inventory management demonstration
- Refund processing example

## 📈 Monitoring & Reporting

The scripts provide detailed insights:
- **Account Balances**: Before/after transaction states
- **Transaction Details**: Hash, gas used, status
- **Payment Amounts**: Exact Ether values transferred
- **Contract States**: Current status and configurations
- **Error Logs**: Detailed failure information

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Input Validation**: All parameters are validated
